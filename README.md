# Autotyper
An autotyper made originally for runescape but functional with other things.


There's a library I imported into the project > [[nuget]](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MouseKeyboardActivityMonitor/4.0.5150.10665)
I have no license or anything on that, so I hope whoever made that is okay with me releasing this.
